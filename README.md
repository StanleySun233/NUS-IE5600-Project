**Project Topic**: A Novel Intelligent System for Collision Avoidance Simulation

**Project Description**:

This project presents a comprehensive system for managing and analyzing maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS)
data, aimed at improving ship tracking accuracy and collision prevention. The system integrates a robust data management
module that allows for the addition, deletion, modification, and querying of both ship and AIS data, along with
cross-referencing capabilities to facilitate data linkage. Key algorithmic contributions include implementing cubic
spline interpolation and the Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) method for trajectory smoothing,
ensuring continuity and stability in dynamic ship movements, especially during maneuvers. To enhance data quality, the
system incorporates a threshold-based AIS data cleaning approach to filter out anomalies. Furthermore, five distinct
collision detection methods are implemented to provide a multi-layered collision risk assessment. The project also
includes visualization tools for generating ship trajectory diagrams and simulating collision scenarios, offering a
visual interface for risk analysis. Together, these features create a reliable framework for maritime safety management,
optimizing both real-time monitoring and post-event analysis.

It can be summary that:
* Data
    1. Implement the functions of adding, deleting, modifying and checking ship and ais data.
    2. Implement the cross-query logic of ship and ais.
* Algorithm
    1. Implement the cubic spline interpolation of `Cubic` and the segmented cubic Hermite interpolation method of
       `Pchip`.
    2. Implement the data cleaning of ais abnormal data through the threshold method.
    3. Implement five detection methods for ship collision.
    4. Generate visual trajectory diagrams and collision simulation videos.
